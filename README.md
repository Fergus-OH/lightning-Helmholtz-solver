The Helmholtz equation is an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) and represents a time-independent form of the wave equation.
It is named after German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and has many applications in physics, including acoustics, seismology, and electromagnetic radiation.
The lightning method for solving PDEs with exceptional speed and accuracy has accomplished remarkable success with its original introduction for solving the Laplace equation, which has a state-of-the-art implementation that solves typical problems in less than 1 second on a desktop to 8-digit accuracy [[1]](#1).
This repository contains `helmholtz.m`, an implementation of the lightning method for solving the Helmholtz equation, carried out during my thesis entitled *Lightning Helmholtz solver*.
I completed this under the supervision of Professor Nick Trefethen as part of the MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford.

`helmholtz.m` solves the Helmholtz equation on a domain exterior to a polygon $P$ for small or medium wavenumbers $k > 0$ (with inhomogenous boundary data).

The solver is best demonstrated by the time-harmonic scattering problem and a brief description of the problem for context follows.
A function that solves the Helmholtz equation is used to sample the boundary 
The solver can handle any valid user-specified boundary sampling function and in fact the boundary data can be specified pointwise for each side of the polygon.
However,

The solver approximates $u$ as to satisfy the following

$$\Delta u(z) + k^2u(z) = 0, \quad z \in \Omega$$

$$u(z) = g(z), \quad z \in P$$

The function $u$ is approximated as to match the incident field and consequently make the total field vanish at the boundary.
Then the total field is represented by $f = u-g$ which has a vanishing field at the boundary by the construction of $u$ matching $g$.
By linearity of the Helmholtz equation and the fact that $g$ satisfies the Helmholtz equation, $f$ satisfies the Helmholtz equation with homogeneous boundary condition, that is
$$\Delta f(z) + k^2f(z) = 0, \quad z \in \Omega$$

$$f(z) = 0, \quad z \in P$$


Concerning the boundary sampling function, $g$, common incident fields that are inbuilt to the solver are the following

propogating plane wave from an angle $\theta$
$$g_\theta(z) = -\exp{\left(-i\text{Re}\left[kze^{-i\theta}\right]\right)} \quad \theta \in [0, 2\pi$$
where $\theta$ is the incident angle of propogation.

point source radiating from a point $z_\*$
$$g_{z_\*}(z) = -H_0^{(1)}\left(k \lvert z - z_{\*} \rvert\right) \quad z_{\*} \in \Omega$$
where $z_\*$ is the location of the point source.

## Usage

`U = helmholtz(wavenum, P, g)` solves the Helmholtz equation with
Dirichlet boundary data on the simply-connected region $\Omega$ bounded by `P`, which may be a polygon or circular polygon.





      
### Input arguments

#### Required positional arguments


1. `wavenum` (non-zero integer)  
    The sign of `wavnum` is used as an indicator to determine the default value for `g`.
    Negative integers are used to indicate plane wave propogation or point source radiation problem.
    The wavenumber for the problem is taken to be the absolute value of `wavnum`, a minus sign can meerly be used as a flag.
    
2. `P` (integer, vector, or string)  
   One of the following:
    - Vector of corners as complex numbers $z = x+iy$ in counterclockwise order to specify a polygon or cell array of corners `v` and pairs `[v r]` to specify a circular polygon: $r =$ radius of curvature of arc from this `v` to the next.
    - string from one of the predefined polygons in the table below.
    -  integer $\ge 3$, the number of corners of a random polygon.
    -  integer $\le -3, -1$ $\times$ no. of corners of a random circular polygon.

#### Optional name-value arguments

Optional pairs of arguments as `Name1, Value1, ..., NameN, ValueN`, where Name is the argument name and Value is the corresponding value.
Name-value arguments must appear after other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.
